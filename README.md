# Machine Learning Projects Collection

This repository features two distinct machine learning projects, each demonstrating crucial aspects of the machine learning workflow from data preparation to in-depth analysis.

## Project 1: Machine Learning for Data Preparation and Normalization

### Overview
This project provides a detailed walkthrough on essential data preparation techniques critical for machine learning, including data loading, cleaning, and normalization/standardization of numerical variables.

### Techniques and Technologies Used
- **Data Preprocessing:** Demonstrates data cleaning and transformation techniques.
- **Normalization/Standardization:** Focuses on scaling numerical data to prepare it for machine learning models.
- **Libraries:** Utilizes Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn among others for data manipulation and preparation.

### How to Run
Steps to set up the environment, install required dependencies, and execute the script or notebook for preprocessing.

## Project 2: Machine Learning Analysis of Census Income Data

### Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to census income data, aiming to uncover insights and predict income levels based on demographic information.

### Techniques and Technologies Used
- **Data Handling:** Instructions on acquiring and preprocessing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Techniques for data visualization and understanding.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Use of machine learning models to analyze and predict income levels.

### How to Run
Guidance on running the analysis, from data download to executing analysis scripts.
